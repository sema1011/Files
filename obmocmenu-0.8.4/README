About this script:
----------------------------------------

This script creates an Openbox pipe menu for managing Music On Console (moc).

A configuration file is available to modify various behaviours. A playlist
directory can be selected to easily play/append a playlist of your choice.

A random list feature has also been added. In these lists, each line is an
entry that can be the full path to a directory, file or playlist. A random
entry is selected from the list. In this way a random album or song can be
added to the current playlist. If zenity is installed, a dialog is used to
ask how many random entries to add. See the configuration file for more
information.



Dependencies:
----------------------------------------

 * openbox
 * moc
 * zenity (optional)

This script has only been tested on Arch Linux using Bash 4.2, Openbox
3.4.11.2, moc 2.5.0-alpha4 and zenity 2.32.1.

I have briefly tested with moc 2.4.4 which is missing a few features. I have
put in a simple test to see the version. The toggle menu will only be shown
if the version is not 2.4.4. If the version is not 2.4.4, the script assumes
that a newer version of moc is being used.



Installation:
----------------------------------------

1. As root, copy "obmocmenu" to "/usr/bin" or anywhere else you have
   included in your $PATH:

    install -m755 obmocmenu /usr/bin/obmocmenu

2. Backup any existing configuration files.

3. As root, copy "obmocmenu.conf" to "/etc/obmocmenu.conf" for global
   configuration:
	
    install -m644 obmocmenu.conf /etc/obmocmenu.conf

4. As your user, copy "obmocmenu.conf" to "~/.config/obmocmenu/config"
   for per-user configuration:

    install -d -m755 ~/.config/obmocmenu/
    install -m644 obmocmenu.conf ~/.config/obmocmenu/config

5. Enjoy!
